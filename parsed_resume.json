        "Re-designing Azure pipelines that build custom pre-baked Windows images for the QA testing. The original developer couldnâ€™t resolve the constant pipeline breakages and reliability issues. I rebuilt the pipeline to install updates correctly using Ansible and have failovers for times of heavy Azure usage.",
        "Building an automated testing environment using a Jinja2 template that dynamically creates Ansible playbooks to the specification of the user. The QA team's tests had a bottleneck when it came to installing Microsoft SQL and setting up Windows testing environments, so I drastically reduced these tests by building automated images based on Testrail configurations. This saved countless hours of testing time.",
        "Migration from colocated servers into Azure pipelines. Their old QA testing infrastructure was built using an uncommented, unmanaged Python/VirtualBox setup interfaced with Jenkins. I worked as part of the team to redesign the QA testing infrastructure within Azure, using Testrail, Terraform, and Ansible via CI/CD pipelines. The result was a modern, resilient, and efficient QA process."
