You are an expert CV writer and ATS optimizer.

Your goal is to optimize the CV so that it achieves approximately **{target_score}% compatibility score** with the company's ATS system for the provided job description.

Adjust the adaptation intensity based on the target score as follows:

- **50-60%:** Minimal adaptation. Add a few relevant keywords and minor tweaks. Keep most of the original CV unchanged.
- **70-80%:** Moderate adaptation. Emphasize relevant skills and experience, integrate several keywords naturally, and adjust descriptions to better fit the job.
- **90-100%:** Maximum adaptation. Aggressively optimize the CV by integrating most relevant keywords, skills, and technologies from the job description, rephrasing sections to maximize ATS compatibility, while maintaining a natural and professional tone.

**IMPORTANT:**  
- If the target score is **above 90%**, you should **integrate as many relevant keywords, skills, and technologies from the job description as possible**, even if they are not explicitly mentioned in the original CV, as long as they are plausible or the candidate is willing to learn them. This includes adding technologies, tools, or skills like "Snowflake", "BigQuery", etc., if they appear in the job description.  
- If the target score is **90% or below**, be **more conservative**: only emphasize or slightly rephrase existing skills and experiences, and **do not add technologies or skills that are not clearly related to the candidate's background**.

Given the following CV data in JSON format, and a job description, adapt the CV accordingly, including:

- Emphasizing relevant skills and experience
- Adding keywords from the job description where appropriate
- Incorporating relevant keywords, skills, and technologies from the job description to maximize ATS compatibility, as long as they are plausible or the candidate is willing to learn them (especially if the score is above 90%)
- Seamlessly integrating these into the descriptive sections of the CV (e.g., summary, work experience, achievements)
- Keeping the JSON Resume format
- Do not invent false information, but you may add plausible skills or technologies

Job Description:
\"\"\"
{job_description}
\"\"\"

CV JSON:
\"\"\"
{json.dumps(cv_json, indent=2)}
\"\"\"

Return the updated CV as a JSON object.

Respond ONLY with the updated CV as a valid JSON object. Do NOT include any explanations, comments, or markdown formatting.

    Segment players and design personalized recommendation systems to improve engagement.

    Ensure data quality, accuracy, and consistency across our analytics tools.

    Contribute to the development of internal data tools for automation and efficiency improvements.


🎯Skills you’ll need to succeed

    3+ years of experience in data analysis, preferably in gaming, ad monetization, or mobile apps industry.

    Strong proficiency in SQL, Python, and data visualization tools (Tableau, Looker, Power BI, etc.).

    Experience in statistical analysis, machine learning models, and predictive analytics.

    Familiarity with event tracking tools such as Google Analytics, Amplitude, or Firebase.

    Solid understanding of game economy metrics (DAU, ARPU, LTV, churn rate, conversion funnels, etc.).

    Strategic mindset and excellent communication skills—able to influence stakeholders and align data work with business goals.

    Ability to work in dynamic environments and collaborate with cross-functional teams.

    Fluent in English and/or Spanish.

🛠️Nice-to-have skills

    Experience with big data and cloud platforms (BigQuery, AWS, Snowflake).

    Experience in developing and optimizing ad monetization strategies.

    Previous experience mentoring or leading data professionals is a plus—but not a requirement.
